# CotonsoPizza
Built a RESTful API using ASP.NET Core to manage a pizza inventory system. Implemented full CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) following Microsoft's official learning path. This project demonstrates my journey learning C# web development and API design principles using industry-standard practices.
